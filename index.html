      <h2>Hello üëã my name is Joshua</h2>
      <h3>I'm a full stack developer with full stack thinking</h3>
      <hr/>
      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>I am a full stack Ruby on Rails developer who <strong>loves</strong> what I do. I am currently looking for new roles.</p>
      <p>
        Prior to coding, I worked in the technology industry for a decade in non-programming roles.
        I founded Shufflehub, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/28/shufflehub-is-for-when-youre-too-lazy-to-shop-online/" target="_blank">TechCrunch Disrupt Nominated startup</a>.
        I twice worked as an investment analyst at <a href="https://dncapital.com" target="_blank">DN Capital</a>, a San Francisco, London and Berlin based top-tier venture capital fund.
        I ran + consulted on user, revenue and margin growth for companies doing upward of ¬£1m ARR while at <a href="https://www.hoxtonmix.com/" target="_blank">The Hoxton Mix</a> and <a href="https://solidstategroup.com/" target="_blank">Solid State Group</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        My previous experiences mean I understand <i>what</i> the code I'm writing is trying to achieve and allow me to feed growth-focused business logic back into any company I work with.
      </p>
      <p>I am based in London.</p>
      <p>My email address is <i>eichler[ d o t ]summers[ a t ]gmail[ d o t ]com</i></p>

      <h3>Projects</h3>

      <h4>1. WALD - We Are Lazy Developers</h4>
      <p>WALD lets users upload a <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EFOjO.png" target="_blank">visual database schema</a> and generates a 'rails new' command which builds the entire application. Additionally, users could choose if they wanted to create a GitHub repository, host the application on Heroku, seed models, scaffold models, and use the devise gem for a user model.</p>
      <p><strong>If you're here to evaluate my profile, please give the video a watch as my team and I were very proud of what we achieved.</strong></p>

        <p class="mb-0">Joshua built at Le Wagon an amazing product. The first time that he brought to me the idea of creating an web app that could create other web apps automatically I thought "This is going to be interesting but really hard to implement"üòÖ. But after two weeks, it was done and working smoothly, that product was one of the best from that batch. Adding to that, Joshua has a really good capacity to learn new topics, he is focused and a nice guy to be around.</p>

        <p>I've met Joshua when he was a student at LeWagon and I was one of his teachers. He had an outstanding performance during the bootcamp and it was one of the best students. He developed a terrific App as his final project using tools and concepts that made the team impressed.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">I've been working with Joshua for the past few weeks in a e-commerce platform, and he has made everything possible. He has suggested new ideas, concept tools and he has demonstrated how awesome developer he is. I would recommend Joshua for any kind of company!</p>
